// 1. user takes quiz

    // set up timer that starts at start button click

        // insert start button that starts timer and removes class .d-none from question div
        // insert 60 second timer in row with header
        // add/remove classes to some objects to progress DOM appearance

    // create submit button that ends game before timer and moves to next step
    // or timer moves on if user hasnt submitted

// 2. answers have specific value that assigns outcome

    // store value from the answers in individual vars
    // create var of total value of each individual var

// 3. results display likelyhood of survival in the wastes and potential "top skill"

    // using total var display answer under submit area that tells user if they
    // are meant to wander out of the vault
    // individual answers will tell the user if they have any particular skills of 
    // value, such as affinity for guns, sneakability, etc.
